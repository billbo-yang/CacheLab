Code for WPI's CacheLab Assignment

The assignment consisted of two parts; a cache simulator part and a matrix transposition part.

**Part A:** csim.c contains code that takes a memory trace as input, then simulate the hit/miss behavior of cache memory on said trace. It then outputs the total number of hits, misses, and evictions.

**Part B:** trans.c contains code that minimizes cache misses to as few as possible.

Note: This was pushed to GitHub to store the code after the class ended as the local repository was about to be deleted. Finished in Spring 2020 Term.
